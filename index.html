                <p>My name is Raven. I grew up in Aurora, CO. I love trying new restaurants! I have previously lived in both NYC and London, UK. I will always fancy a cuppa tea. 
                    I have many quirks, and am eerily quiet at times. This photo was taken while I was on a trip to Venice, Italy. I had always wanted to visit Italy since I was a child!
                    I really enjoy learning about different cultures. Experiencing new foods, different languages and different customs fascinate me. If I had the time and the money, 
                    I would spend lots of it traveling around the world. Eventually I would like to make my way over to Asia, and visit Japan! For now, I am stuck here in Colorado.
